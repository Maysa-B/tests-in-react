## Tests in React
Project developed at the end of block 15, in which I studied about _React Testing Library (RTL)_.

### How it works
Using the library of tests most indicated by React, I produced tests to test an application given from Trybe for the students. It was necessary to cover a big part of the features of the website.

> It's important to highlight that some documents were provided by Trybe, to help us develop the project. This kind of document has a comment specifying that.
