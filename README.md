## Tests in React
Project developed at the end of block 15, in which I studied about _React Testing Library (RTL)_.

### How it works
Using the library of tests most indicated by React, I produced tests to test an application given from Trybe for the students. It was necessary to cover a big part of the features of the website.

> It's important to highlight that only the documents produced by me are in the repository. For some of the projects, Trybe, which is the course that I'm following, gives us some functions/objects/styling that helps us to conclude the project, so the repository may seem incomplete.

If you see something that can be improved, please contact me! All feedback is very welcome.:sparkles:
